# This action installs a few dependencies necessary to build Bevy on Linux. By default it installs
# alsa and udev, but can be configured to also install Wayland dependencies:
#
# ```
# - uses: ./.github/actions/install-linux-deps
#   with:
#     wayland: true
# ```
#
# See the `inputs` section for all options and their defaults. Note that you must checkout the
# repository before you can use this action.
#
# This action will only install dependencies when the current operating system is Linux. It will do
# nothing on any other OS (macOS, Windows).
